# AutoScout24 German Car Market - Microsoft Excel and Tableau Desktop Project :bar_chart:
In my Spring 2022 semester, I completed a project in my Business Analytics (BUS150) course in which I used Microsoft Excel and Tableau Desktop to analyze a dataset that contains information about 46,400+ AutoScout24 cars sold in Germany between 2011 and 2021. I first revamped the dataset on Excel so that Tableau could interpret the information on the spreadsheet correctly. Using Tableau, I compared horsepower to other fields such as make, model, offer type, gear type, fuel type, and price, and I visualized my findings through constructing tables and charts to determine which car types have the highest horsepower.
